## Part I: Overview of Scikit-Learn Python Library

This repository contains an overview of the Scikit-Learn Python Library package in a Jupyter notebook.

### Quick Steps

You can view the Scikit-Learn notebook in static form by selecting the NBVIEWER image[1] below: 

[![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.org/github/juliandunne1234/machineLearning_assesment_g00267940/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb) 

You can view the Scikit-Learn notebook in dynamic form by selecting the Binder[2] image below:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/juliandunne1234/machineLearning_assesment_g00267940/HEAD?labpath=scikit-learn.ipynb)

### How to run the scikit-learn notebook: 

1. Download [Anaconda]().
2. Download [cmder] if on Windows.
3. Run `jupyter lab`.

### Classification: Linear Regression
This section contains analysis of the Wine Quality dataset. The dataset is looked at initially to find correlations between each of the variables and how they impact the quality of the wine.<br>
The dataset is then pre-processed, reducing the amount of variables in the dataset to improve the accuracy of the algorithm.<br>
Finally the algorithm is trained to identify and categorise objects using the training data.

***

### Regression: Polynomial Regression
This section contains analysis of the Boston Housing dataset. The dataset is looked at initially to find a correlations between each of the variables in the dataset.<br>
Two variables were then chosen ('noc', 'dis').<br>
Finally the model is trained to identify patterns within the training dataset using Polynomial Regression.

***

### Classification: Random Forrest Classifier
This section applies the Random Forest Classifier machine learning algorithm to the sklearn Digits Dataset.<br>
The digits dataset consists of 8x8 pixel images of digits that the algorithm tries to predict. As part of this analysis the images incorrectly predicted by the algorithm are shown along with the actual and predicted values.

## Part II: Overview of Scipy-Stats Python Library

This repository contains an overview of the Scipy-Stats Python Library package in a Jupyter notebook.

### Quick Steps

You can view the Scipy-Stats notebook in static form by selecting the NBVIEWER image[1] below:

### How to run the SciPy STATS notebook:

1. Download [Anaconda]().
2. Download [cmder] if on Windows.
3. Run `jupyter lab`.

***
### One-Way ANOVA:
This section contains a dataset of participants that went on one of three different diets. The dataset is modified so that it can be used when performing a One-way ANOVA test.<br>
The purpose of the ANOVA test is to demonstrate statistical significance and show whether the Hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean amount of weight loss when comparing the three different diets should be accepted or rejected.
